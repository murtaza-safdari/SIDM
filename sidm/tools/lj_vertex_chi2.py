"""Best within-LJ dimuon-vertex normChi2, per lepton jet.

For each mu-type LJ, find every stored dimuon vertex (DSAMuonVertex,
PatMuonVertex, PatDSAMuonVertex) whose BOTH legs are constituents of that LJ,
and return the smallest normChi2 among them; -1.0 if no such vertex exists.

On this branch the three vertex tables are already registered in
sidm/definitions/objects.py and SidmProcessor fills ljs["vtx_chi2"]
automatically, so there is nothing to do at call time.

Standalone usage on NanoEvents (LLPNanoAOD; the vertex tables are present in
the 2018 signal files and in the data/background skims):

    ljs["vtx_chi2"] = lj_best_vertex_chi2(
        ljs.pfMuons.idx, ljs.dsaMuons.idx,
        [(evts.DSAMuonVertex, "dsa"), (evts.PatMuonVertex, "pat"),
         (evts.PatDSAMuonVertex, "mix")])

    # keep-cut: rejects LJs whose muons never form a converged dimuon vertex,
    # the signature of fake or cosmic muon pairings
    keep = (ljs.vtx_chi2 >= 0) & (ljs.vtx_chi2 < 5)

Notes:
- Only defined for LJs with >= 2 muons. A single-muon LJ can never have a
  within-LJ vertex, so it is always -1.0; pair any vtx_chi2 cut or histogram
  with "Mu >= 2".
- -1.0 means "no stored within-LJ vertex", and nothing else. A real vertex
  with a huge normChi2 keeps its value (values above 1e7 occur) and lands in
  the histogram overflow.
- Unlike the *Spread_* variables, which fill 0 (= passes) when a muon category
  is absent, -1.0 FAILS the keep-cuts by design, so the veto rejects both
  bad-fit LJs and no-vertex LJs.
- If the input sample lacks the vertex tables entirely, SidmProcessor sets
  vtx_chi2 to NaN and every vtx_chi2 cut (keep AND inverse) then selects
  nothing; an exactly empty channel is the symptom, so check the worker logs
  for "dsaMuonVertex not found". The samples in sidm/configs/ntuples/
  (signal_2mu2e_v10, signal_4mu_v10, data_skimmed, backgrounds) all carry the
  tables.
- The producer (cms-sidm/LLPNanoAOD, MuonVertexTableProducer) only stores
  pairs whose Kalman fit converged and with DCA < 15 cm, so "no within-LJ
  vertex" is itself informative: fakes rarely have one. The isValid filter
  below is a defensive re-check of the same requirement.
- Vertex-table columns are float-typed (including indices and flags); the
  membership test compares float indices, exact for these values.
- The same muon appears in many vertex rows (all pairings are fitted); the
  min over matched rows makes that harmless.
- If your LJ objects do not carry constituent .idx, pass any two per-LJ
  index lists (PF-muon and DSA-muon indices of the LJ constituents).
- Validated by the brute-force closure test in
  sidm/tools/test_lj_vertex_chi2.py.
