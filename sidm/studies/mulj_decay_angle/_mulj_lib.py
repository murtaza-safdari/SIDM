"""Helpers for the muon lepton-jet decay-angle study.

`mulj_decay_angle.ipynb` is a thin driver: every figure and every number in it comes from a
function defined here, so a single figure can be regenerated on its own after the inputs
change.

Inputs are the per-sample `.coffea` files written by the study's Condor campaign, one
merged file per sample.  Point `INPUT_DIR` at the directory holding them -- a local path,
or an EOS `root://` URL, which is copied to a local cache on first use -- and the sample
lists follow from what is actually there.  Nothing else in the notebook needs editing.

Normalisation, in one place because it is easy to get wrong: the campaign ran with
`--unweighted-hist`, so the histograms are RAW COUNTS with no cross-section or generator
weight applied.  The cutflows stored in the same files ARE luminosity x cross-section
scaled.  The two must never be combined.  `lumi_xs_weight()` implements the per-sample MC
rescaling (lumi x sigma / N_generated) for when a normalised MC prediction is wanted; the
shape comparisons in this study are unit-area and do not use it.

Figure conventions implemented by `Canvas`:
  * figures are designed for placement at 7.5 in text width, so every piece of in-figure
    text is sized as `base_pt / print_scale` with `print_scale = 7.5 / figure_width`;
  * a grid is never more than 1.15x taller than it is wide;
  * the CMS label is drawn exactly once, by `Canvas.finish()`, after all panels, legends
    and colour bars exist -- that call also freezes the constrained layout;
  * legends take an explicit location, and get an opaque backing when they sit over data;
  * efficiency points are drawn only where the denominator holds at least 20 entries;
  * log axes get explicit minor ticks.
